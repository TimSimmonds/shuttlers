### [MEDIUM] Keyboard Caching of Sensitive Input
- **Issue:** Email input field in `passwordDialog` was missing `enableSuggestions: false`.
- **Impact:** OS-level keyboard might cache user emails, potentially exposing them.
- **Fix:** Added `enableSuggestions: false` to the email `TextField` in `lib/ui/screens/home_screen.dart`.
